🎙️ EVA: AI Voice Assistant for Inclusive Banking

The future of financial operations is hands-free, conversational, and accessible to everyone.

🌟 Overview: Banking, Reimagined

Traditional digital banking interfaces often fail the visually impaired, the elderly, and the digitally less confident, leading to frustration and high error rates.

EVA (Explain, Validate, Assist) is an intelligent, non-intrusive AI Voice Assistant that embeds conversational guidance directly into the banking UI. It acts as a friendly, multilingual virtual banker, guiding users step-by-step through complex financial tasks.

Our mission: Eliminate digital exclusion and form abandonment by making every banking task fully audible, understandable, and manageable via voice.

✨ Key Capabilities & The EVA Model
